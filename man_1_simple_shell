.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.RI [command_file]
.br
Or run interactively and enter commands line by line.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
program is a lightweight command-line interpreter that emulates the behavior of the standard UNIX shell (\fB/bin/sh\fR).

It reads commands either from the standard input or from a file and executes them.
The shell supports basic command execution, argument passing, and environment variable lookups.

If run in interactive mode, it displays a prompt (\fB($)\fR) and waits for the user to type commands.
In non-interactive mode, it reads and executes commands from standard input (for example, when piped from another command or file).

The shell will:
.IP \[bu]
Display a prompt and wait for input (interactive mode)
.IP \[bu]
Read and execute commands line by line
.IP \[bu]
Search for executables in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable
.IP \[bu]
Execute programs using the \fBexecve()\fR system call
.IP \[bu]
Terminate when the user types \fBexit\fR or reaches end-of-file (Ctrl+D)

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive mode:
.PP
.EX

hsh main.c shell.c
($) exit
.EE

Non-interactive mode:
.PP
.EX
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c
.EE

.SH RETURN VALUE
The program returns the exit status of the last executed command.
If no command is executed, it returns 0.
